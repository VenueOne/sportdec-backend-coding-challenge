# Sportdec backend coding challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the coding challenge for developers interested in __backend__ roles in Sportdec. It's not an against-the-clock time challenge - you can complete it at home in your own time. 

Ideally you will return your submission in __within 7 days__ - the sooner you get your submission back to us, the more quickly we can progress your application to interview stage.

## The Challenge
1. Create a commandline API mashup of the Github and Twitter APIs
2. Search for "Football" projects on GitHub then, for a chosen subset of these projects, search for tweets mentioning those projects
3. Output the Github summary of each project together with a list of recent tweets

## Instructions
While you're free to choose the technologies you wish to use to complete this challenge, submissions in Node.js, Java, C#, or Go are preferred.

- We expect your submission to be production quality - __we leave it to your own judgement what this should entail__
- Include any instructions required to run your submission (in Markdown format)

## Deadline
- While there is no specific deadline, we request that you return your submission __within 7 days__
- We're more interested in how you approach and complete the challenge than how quickly

## Guidelines
- You will require a Twitter consumer key and secret to complete this challenge 
- Do not include any private details with your submission. We suggest you make any private values such as API keys configurable
- As the Twitter API is rate limited retrieving tweets for a maximum of 10 projects will be sufficient
- Publish your submission to Github as a repo, adding the following Sportdec team members as collaborators:
  - `@dereklawless`
  - `@onlydave`
  - `@esdrasportillo`
  - `@mkempf`
